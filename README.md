## Project Overview

Lorexicon is an AI-powered companion module for Foundry VTT. Currently it is designed specifically for Pathfinder 2e Remaster. With Lorexicon, you can:

- Create immersive scene descriptions, creature compositions, and artwork directly in the Journal
- Generate fully formed, immediately usable Pathfinder 2e Remaster Actors on the fly
- Conjure either unique NPCs or generic creatures
- Produce NPC and creature portraits without leaving Foundry

Lorexicon integrates seamlessly into your GM toolkit so you spend less time on menus and more time telling your story.

**Fergusware covers all AI service costs** for Lorexicon through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/fergusware/about) memberships. You will not incur any additional AI fees when using this module. _An AI API key is NOT required to use Lorexicon._

> **Note:** Lorexicon is run as a hosted service on Amazon Web Services. The Lorexicon codebase is proprietary and hosted in a private repository. This public repo is dedicated solely to support, feedback, and community discussion.

See our current [Feature List](https://support.fergusware.com/lorexicon-support/Features) and upcoming [Development Roadmap](https://support.fergusware.com/lorexicon-support/Roadmap)!
