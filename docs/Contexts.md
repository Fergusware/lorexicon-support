# **üìú The Lorexicon Codex of Contexts**

_Reusable Arcane Scrolls for Consistent Creation_

---

### Chapter I: What Are Contexts?

Contexts are Lorexicon's modular memory scrolls--personal grimoires you inscribe once, then reuse in any prompt. Whether it's your homebrew setting, house rules, or a tragic backstory that shapes your campaign world, you no longer need to rewrite the same tale with every summoning.

Each context is a reusable block of text that Lorexicon includes with your prompt. Select one, or many, to inform the forge before casting your spell. The result: consistency, coherence, and faster invocations every time.

### Chapter II: Why Use Contexts?

Summoners often repeat themselves. You describe your world. Your rules. Your tone. Again. And again. Contexts eliminate this cycle:

- Keep your prompts short--your world lives in your contexts.
- Reuse critical lore across multiple creations.
- Maintain consistency of tone, theme, mechanics, and mood.

Think of them as bound familiars--faithfully whispering the same truths into every ritual, never forgetting your instructions.

### Chapter III: The Limits of Mortal Scrolls

While mighty, contexts are not infinite in size or number:

- **Each context scroll may hold up to 2,500 characters.**
  Enough for a robust chunk of lore--but not your entire setting. Keep them modular.

- **You may select multiple contexts at once.**
  Stack your setting, tone, and rules together for richer conjurations.

- **The total input limit (prompt + all selected contexts) is 12,000 characters.**
  Should your combined rune-casting exceed this limit, Lorexicon shall reject your plea until it is trimmed.

_Choose wisely. Layer cleverly. Create consistently._

### Chapter IV: How to Use Contexts in Your Summoning

1. **From the prompt portal**, any existing contexts will display automatically.
2. **Create a new context** using the ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù button. Give the missive a name and inscribe your scroll (up to 2,500 characters).
3. **Check the box** next to any context you wish to include with your current ritual.
4. The selected scrolls will be silently included when your prompt is forged.

Your contexts are remembered between sessions and can be reused across realms. You may edit them, rename them, or banish them to the void at any time.

### Chapter V: Best Practices from the Arcane Archives

- **Break large ideas into multiple contexts.** For example:

  - "Local Campaign Setting"
  - "Undead House Rules"
  - "Narrative Tone"

- **Use consistent naming** so your future self understands the purpose of each scroll.

- **Review your character count** in the bottom-right of the prompt panel to ensure you remain within the 12,000-character ritual limit.

- **When in doubt, test.** The best way to learn context stacking is to try it. See how your creations shift as you add or remove scrolls.

### Chapter VI: What Contexts Cannot Do (Yet)

- Contexts do not "learn" or adapt unless you edit them.
- Contexts are not automatically applied--you must choose them per summoning.

But fear not, adventurer--your feedback will shape their evolution. The Guild of Lorexicon listens.

_Go forth, O scribe, and inscribe your truths into the Codex of Contexts. Let no flame of lore be lost, nor a single house rule be forgotten._
