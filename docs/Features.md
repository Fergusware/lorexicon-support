# Features

Lorexicon currently offers the following features:

- **Pathfinder 2e Remaster NPC generation**  
  Generate complete NPC stat blocks adhering to Pathfinder 2e Remaster rules.

- **Pathfinder 2e Remaster generic creature generation**  
  Create balanced, level-appropriate creature stat blocks following Remaster guidelines.

- **Pathfinder 2e Remaster hazard generation**
  Generate clear, rules-accurate simple hazards with defined triggers, effects, disable conditions, and reset behavior, ready to drop directly into play without additional cleanup.

- **Actor creation with embedded automation links**  
  All Actors are created automatically, complete with linked rolls for templates, damage, defense rolls, flat checks, perception checks, and skill checks. All markup follows the PF2e module's [Style Guide](https://github.com/foundryvtt/pf2e/wiki/Style-Guide).

- **Spell assignment from the SRD for spellcasters**
  All Actors created as spellcasters have a set of appropriate spells selected from the SRD
  and are created with the necessary spellcasting entries, including attack bonus and DC.

- **Effect Item generation for automation**  
  Each action template comes complete with the rule elements necessary to automate its effects. Simply drag the effect onto the appropriate actor and we'll take care of the rest.

- **Full Foundry automation support**
  Hazards benefit from the same automation pipeline as Actors, including rule elements, linked rolls, effects, and auras -- allowing hazards to apply conditions, influence movement, and interact dynamically with the battlefield without manual bookkeeping.

- **Encounter creation with full details**  
  Automatically craft fully balanced PF2e encounters—complete with smart monster composition, dynamic party-size scaling, ready-to-use scene art and narrative, and one-click Foundry journal entries—to slash your prep time.

- **Reusable Context support for consistent results**
  [Define persistent context blocks](Contexts)—-like your campaign setting, house rules, or plot arcs—-and reuse them across creations to maintain narrative and mechanical consistency without rewriting the same prompt every time.

- **Images for all creations**  
  If you choose, automatically generate portrait and scene art for every creation.

- **Follows all guidance for encounter design per [Encounter Design](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2715)**
