## Glenhaven - Example Context

The Glenhaven Campaign is a dark fantasy Pathfinder 2e Remaster adventure centered around the remote town of Glenhaven and its cursed twin, the abandoned town of Gloomhaven. The story follows a party of adventurers as they uncover a growing undead threat orchestrated by **Griznak the Malignant**, a goblin necromancer and member of the **Midnight Conclave** -- a secretive cabal born from the long-defeated Shadeweavers, who once manipulated and imprisoned souls.

The party begins investigating a series of kidnappings, uncovering clues like griefbound relics, personal items, and visions triggered by divination magic. They explore haunted forests, desecrated cemeteries, and the ruins of Gloomhaven, where they encounter ghostly memories and undead lieutenants such as Selyra Graveshadow and Lady Verisca. These lieutenants serve as echoes of the Conclave’s ancient power, guarding secrets beneath tombs and manors, including Duskveil Manor -- a crumbling noble estate once tied to forbidden pacts.

A key element is the **Ebon Shroud**, an artifact used in the **Ritual of Eternal Night**, which Griznak hopes to complete. The party must navigate increasingly dangerous spiritual and physical threats, uncovering lost memories, interacting with grief-bound spirits, and performing rituals to access hidden places -- such as summoning the spectral boat **Gloamrunner** via a blood-binding rite using the **Blade of Passage**.

The campaign’s themes include corruption, loss, memory, and the burden of choices made long ago. Encounters often include environmental storytelling, undead foes (wraiths, specters, skeletal knights), moral decisions, and echoes of past tragedies that influence the present.
