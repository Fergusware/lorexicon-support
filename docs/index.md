## 📜 Contexts

Lorexicon’s modular memory scrolls — the secret to keeping your worlds consistent and alive.
Each **Context** is a reusable grimoire of knowledge: a house rule, a kingdom’s lore, or the saga of a fallen hero.
Store them once, summon them whenever you weave new tales, and watch Lorexicon shape its creations to match your world’s voice and history.

## 💡 Inspiration

Step right up, good traveler, and lend me thine ear! If thou seekest more than a mere list of wonders — if thou wouldst know how to wield Lorexicon, not just behold its works — then thou art in the right place.

Within lie sparks and seed-thoughts aplenty: clever promptings and playful notions meant to stir thy imagination, quicken thy wit, and help thee spin tales whether thou hast hours to prepare or but a heartbeat to spare. Take what pleases thee, twist it to thy liking, and make it thine own — for these ideas are tools, not commandments, and Lorexicon thrives in the hands of a bold improviser.
