# Lorexicon's Frequently Asked Questions

_Sharpen your quill, brave traveler —- here lie the answers to your most pressing inquiries, seasoned with a dash of humor and a pinch of RPG flair._

## 📜 General

**Q: So what does it do?**

**A:** Lorexicon is your enchanted grimoire, woven into the very heart of Foundry VTT. Speak your desire -- be it a harrowing dungeon showdown, a web of courtly intrigue, or the summons of a fearsome beast—and it will conjure a fully realized Pathfinder 2e encounter, NPC, or creature before your eyes. With a flourish of its arcane quill, it drafts balanced monster rosters with dynamic party-size scaling, weaves evocative scene art and narrative text, and inscribes every stat, skill check, and tactic directly into a Foundry document. When the ritual completes, your “Lorexicon” folder overflows with ready-to-play encounters, stat blocks, portraits, and tokens—no manual import, no tedium—just pure, instantaneous creation at your command.

**Q: What can Lorexicon summon for me?**

**A:** Lorexicon channels the arcane intelligence of a complex Pathfinder 2e rules engine, assisted by AI, to conjure everything you need for your next session -- fully formed Pathfinder 2e Actors (NPCs and creatures) complete with backgrounds, GM notes, stats, skills, tactics, and entire encounters balanced to your party’s size. Speak your prompt, and watch as it weaves monster rosters, narrative text, and scene art, then binds them all into Foundry as ready-to-play journal entries, tokens, and maps -- just pure magical creation.

**Q: What detailed runes does Lorexicon inscribe for me when creating an Actor?**

**A:** Every spark of creation you invoke, Lorexicon weaves into a fully realized Actor, complete with every rune and detail you could desire:

- **Detailed Concept**: A rich backstory and GM notes to bring your creation to life.
- **Statistics**: Rarity, Size, Traits, Attributes, Hit Points, Speeds, Perception, Initiative, Senses, and Languages.
- **Defenses**: AC, Fortitude, Reflex, Will -- plus Immunities, Resistances, and Weaknesses.
- **Skills**: All trained skill modifiers, ready for checks.
- **Attacks**: Melee and Ranged weapon entries, each with damage formulas and traits.
- **Actions**:

  - Standard Actions, Reactions, Free Actions, and Passive abilities
  - Flavor text to enliven each maneuver
  - Support for Area Effects and Checks (Defense, Flat, Perception, Skill)
  - Damage rolls with inline, clickable controls -- styled exactly to the [PF2e Style Guide](https://github.com/foundryvtt/pf2e/wiki/Style-Guide).
  - Effects -- ready to drag and drop onto actors on the scene to apply automated rule elements

- **Portrait Images**: (Optional) A thematic illustration to grace your token and character sheet.

All of this is conjured in one seamless ritual -- no tedious copy-pasting, no manually poring over tables in arcane tomes, no missing details -- so you can focus on the story, not the stat block.

**Q: What detailed runes does Lorexicon inscribe for me when creating a Hazard?**

**A:** Each Hazard Lorexicon forges arrives fully realized and ready to deploy in Foundry, with no manual assembly required:

- **Hazard Concept**: A clear, thematic description grounded in your world, region, and scene context.
- **Classification**: Trap, Haunt, or Environmental hazard; magical or mundane; with intent-based behavior (alerting, offensive, obstructive, and more).
- **Statistics**: Level, Stealth, Disable conditions, Hardness, Hit Points, and relevant defenses.
- **Reactions**: Fully automated reactions with inline rolls, saving throws, and rule element effects.
- **Disable & Reset Logic**: Purpose-built text describing how the hazard can be disarmed, bypassed, or rearmed.
- **Aura Support**: Optional auras that apply automated effects to creatures in range.
- **Foundry Integration**: A PF2e-native Hazard actor—no copy-pasting, no missing automation.

All of this is conjured in a single step, letting you add meaningful danger to your adventure without slowing down play—or prep.

**Q: What detailed runes does Lorexicon inscribe for me when creating an Encounter?**

**A:** With every invocation, Lorexicon weaves a tapestry of arcane runes into a complete, ready-to-run encounter:

- **Encounter Synopsis**: A thematic title, key objectives, and stakes to frame the scene.
- **Monster Roster**: SRD creatures hand-picked to suit your theme—with a primary recommendation and one or two stalwart alternates, each fully detailed with stat blocks ready for immediate use.
- **Scaling Guidance**: Automatic scaling for party-size adjustments.
- **Environment & Hazards**: Terrain features, obstacles, and traps.
- **Narrative Text**: Vivid scene-setting prose and GM cues to spark player immersion.
- **Visual Summonings**: A generated scene illustration to anchor your players' imaginations.
- **Journal Integration**: A Foundry-ready journal entry with title, description, tags, tokens, and map placement.

**Q: When are creatures selected for my encounter?**

**A:** Aye, the type of encounter you conjure determines what springs forth from the forge's vaults! For **Combat** and **Pursuit** encounters, Lorexicon reaches into the Bestiary and Monster Core, plucking forth fearsome creatures to test your party's mettle. For **Moral** and **Social** encounters, you'll instead summon forth **NPCs** from the NPC Core and NPC Gallery--vivid personas with their own agendas and convictions, ready to parley or persuade. The other encounter types—such as **Discovery**—concern themselves with the shape of the land and the secrets it holds, and thus don't involve direct creature selection. In short: the encounter's very nature determines who (or what) you'll meet.

**Q: That name, tho...**

**A:** Aye, Lorexicon is incanted as 'low-REX-ih-KAHN.' Slice together **Lore** and **Lexicon**, and you’ve bound a 'dictionary of lore' —- the perfect grimoire for your Foundry. Truth be told, we tried a few dozen other arcane titles, but every worthy name was already claimed by other wizards. Thus we arrived at Lorexicon: a unique fusion worthy of its magic.

## 💰 What Does It Cost?

**Q: Must I pay gold to harness Lorexicon’s power?**

**A:** Fear not, intrepid GM -- Lorexicon itself bears no charge to install. All explorers of the forge may sample its magic with a handful of free creations each moon (month). Beyond that, a modest Patreon pact is required to replenish your allotment of conjurations.

**Q: How do I pledge my support to the Guild?**

**A:** Simply voyage to our Patreon stronghold and select the tier that best suits your adventuring needs. Each tier grants additional monthly spell slots -- more creations, more glory! Your pledge sustains the Guild’s scribes and fuels ever-greater innovations in the arcane arts.

**Q: Where can I view the tiers, prices, and limits?**

**A:** Seek the full slate of offerings on our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cw/fergusware/membership) page: There you’ll find all the details -- tier names, monthly creation limits, and the gold required to maintain your legendary status.

_Embark upon your journey with confidence, knowing that whether you walk the path of the free scribe or rise as a golden archmage, Lorexicon’s grimoire awaits your command!_

## 🖋️ The Art of Prompting

**Q: How vague or specific should my incantation be?**

**A:** Lorexicon delights in the mists of ambiguity. A simple whisper -- "A forest ambush" or “A cunning goblin rogue” -- can bloom into a tapestry of detail far richer than you might expect. Trust its creativity, and you may find wondrous surprises.

**Q: Will it heed my detailed directives?**

**A:** In most cases, yes. If you decree “Severe threat encounter with a group of bandits” or “Fire mage with a staff of ember, Knowledge (Arcana) focus, and Slow (Enchantment) cantrip,” the Lorexicon’s quill will strive to honor each rune. Yet know this: even the most precise spells allow for a spark of improvisation. While parsing your intent, the LLM may embellish or interpret your vision to keep the story alive.

**Q: What if my prompt grows too long or labyrinthine?**

**A:** Lengthy scrolls of instruction can sometimes confound the arcane forge. When the ritual grows over‐elaborate, the LLM may wend its own path, weaving in unexpected threads. For best results, strike a balance -- focus on the essentials, then let Lorexicon fill the tapestry’s finer stitches.

**Q: Can I demand exact hazards, environments, abilities, or statistics?**

**A:** You may petition for them, but know that the Lorexicon’s arcane muse values narrative over pedantic precision. Your specific requests -- “create a skill challenge in an active volcano” -- will often appear, but occasionally the forge substitutes or adjusts values for balance. Embrace the variance; it breeds freshness in your tales.
**Q: Do the encounters provide specific creatures?**

**A:** Indeed they do! Lorexicon's enchanted forge now selects creatures directly from the Pathfinder 2e SRD, weaving them into your encounter with a primary recommendation and one or two stalwart alternates-—should the first prove unsuitable for your tale. This marriage of narrative and mechanics means your encounter arrives with both evocative scene descriptions _and_ precise stat blocks ready to deploy.

Should the forge's search prove fruitless (perchance a most peculiar thematic demand leaves the archives bare), Lorexicon will gracefully fall back to generic creature roles, ensuring your encounter still takes shape. Your creations are never left wanting—-only the form may shift.

**Q: How do I master the forge’s creativity?**

**A:** Treat your prompt as an invocation, not a blueprint. Name the soul or theme you desire, hint at its power and purpose, then step back. Lorexicon will sculpt the rest, blending your vision with its own enchanted insights. The result: Actors that feel alive, not just assembled.

## 🛠️ Customization & Content

**Q: Why do the Actors have so many abilities? It seems like too many.**

**A:** We’ve deliberately over-provisioned each Actor with a generous suite of talents -- imagine gifting your adventurers a well-stocked armory rather than a single blade. This abundance ensures you, the GM, can cherry-pick the most evocative abilities to fit your story, rather than being constrained by a bare-bones template. Think of it as choice over scarcity: you’ll never wish you had more options when crafting the perfect encounter. _If you prefer a leaner build, simply remove or ignore the extras -- your game, your rules._

**Q: What spells will my spellcaster receive?**

**A:** When Lorexicon identifies an Actor as a primary spellcaster -- whether wizard, sorcerer, cleric, or another spell-slinging vocation -- it draws a curated selection of spells directly from the Pathfinder 2e SRD, carefully tailored to match the Actor's level, tradition, and role in combat. These spells arrive ready to use, integrated seamlessly into the Actor. No need to hunt through tomes and scrolls yourself -- your spellcaster emerges from the forge already armed with an arsenal of incantations, ready for battle or intrigue.

**Q: Does Lorexicon understand prompts in languages other than English?**

**A:** Indeed! The Lorexicon’s arcane engine can decipher incantations penned in tongues beyond Common. Yet, for now, its quill faithfully scripts its replies in the Common tongue alone. Fear not -- behind the scenes our scribes have etched the runes for a truly multilingual grimoire. As our patrons' voices rise, we shall prioritize weaving full localization into both prompts and interface, letting Elven, Dwarven, and other dialects join the chorus of creation. Should you wish to lend your own quill to this grand endeavor of translation, dispatch a raven to our scribes and join us on this journey!

**Q: What kinds of hazards does Lorexicon support?**

**A:** Lorexicon sets its hand to three well-worn crafts: **Environmental**, **Haunt**, and **Trap** hazards, each forged in accordance with Pathfinder 2e Remaster tradition. Environmental hazards shape the battlefield itself—treacherous ground, choking vapors, unstable stone -- ever-present and impartial in their cruelty. Traps are the cunning work of mortal hands, sprung by pressure, motion, or meddling fingers, their purpose swift and decisive. Haunts, by contrast, are wounds in the world -- echoes of grief, malice, or unfinished rites -- that lash out with uncanny will when disturbed. These forms share a common virtue: they strike cleanly, resolve clearly, and integrate seamlessly with Foundry’s automation, allowing danger to feel alive without demanding constant arbitration. In this trinity of peril, Lorexicon finds the perfect balance between atmosphere, mechanics, and reliable play at the table.

**Q: Why doesn’t Lorexicon support Complex Hazards?**

**A:** Because a Complex Hazard is no mere snare of wire and spring, but a clockwork contraption of malice—one that takes its own turn, shifts its posture with the passing moments, and answers meddling hands with layered reprisals. To conjure such a thing faithfully demands careful keeping of time, states, and consequences; done poorly, it becomes cacophony instead of challenge. Thus does Lorexicon choose the honest path: to craft simple hazards swiftly and well, while leaving these grand engines of peril to deliberate, bespoke forging by the GM's own hand. When at last Lorexicon takes up this heavier art, it shall do so with the same discipline and rigor granted to Actors—no sooner, and never in haste.

**Q: Why do the encounters not provide specific creatures or statistics?**

**A:** We’ve chosen to let the magic of prose paint the danger rather than drown you in numbers -- imagine a bard’s stirring tale of a haunted crypt instead of a dry list of modifiers. By focusing on vivid scene descriptions, balanced roles, and thematic hooks, Lorexicon leans into the LLM’s strength at evocative narrative. You still have full control: summon the Actors afterward to conjure precise stat blocks when you’re ready for the mechanics. _If you crave every die roll and damage formula up front, simply generate the corresponding Actors to pair with your encounter._

## 📦 Contexts

**Q: What are “Contexts,” and why should I care?**

**A:** Contexts are your reusable fragments of narrative truth -- campaign lore, house rules, character arcs, thematic vibes -- all tucked into neat little scrolls. Instead of rewriting the same sacred texts over and over, you simply select the ones that apply, and Lorexicon will whisper them into the forge as part of your summoning. Think of it as preloading your spellbook with the right flavor of magic for the task at hand.

**Q: Can I carry more than one context into a prompt?**

**A:** Of course! Select as many as you need -- whether you're juggling the local town's gloomy secrets, the party's tragic backstories, or a splash of homebrew rules. Lorexicon will faithfully include them all... just mind the overall incantation length.

**Q: Is there a limit to how long each context can be?**

**A:** Aye. Each individual context scroll may hold up to **2,500 characters** -- enough for a full town’s worth of flavor, but not an entire encyclopedia. Keep them focused and modular so they can be recombined like runes in a spell.

**Q: Do contexts count toward the total prompt limit?**

**A:** Indeed they do. All selected contexts are bound into your request before it is cast, and together with your main prompt, they must fit within the **12,000 character** ritual limit. If your summoning fails to ignite, trim a scroll or shorten your plea.

**Q: How are my Contexts stored and used?**

**A:** Each Context you craft is kept safely within your own vault — private to you and visible only on your account. When you select one for a creation, Lorexicon briefly whispers its contents into the forge for that single act of summoning, then releases it back into the aether. The Context itself remains in your vault; it is never shared, learned from, or remembered by the LLM beyond that request.

**Q: Is my data used to train the AI or shared with anyone else?**

**A:** Absolutely not. Lorexicon uses the OpenAI API strictly for generation -- specifically the /v1/chat/completions, /v1/image/generations, and /v1/moderations endpoints. According to [OpenAI’s data-usage policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/your-data), data sent to these APIs is not used to train their models unless an explicit opt-in is given. We have not opted in, and no other party has access to your Contexts. Your lore remains your own.

**Q: Will my Context affect other users or future creations?**

**A:** Never. Each user’s spellbook stands alone; your Contexts influence only the conjurations you perform while they’re active. Once you dismiss or deselect them, they vanish from the forge entirely, leaving future summons untouched.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

**Q: What does the Guild know of me?**

**A:** Little indeed, adventurer. We collect only:

- Your Patreon user ID (a numeric identifier)
- Your Guild rank (Patreon tier)
  That is all we require to open the gates of creation to you. We do not track your email, name, location, or browsing habits.

Should you wish to sever your ties with the Guild, just click the little chain-breaker icon next to your Patreon login. Your account will be unlinked instantly—no questions asked, no lingering enchantments.

> “A wise mage keeps no more records than they can defend.”

**Q: Do you have access to my payment information?**

**A:** Perish the thought! The Lorexicon's Guild is bound by ancient oaths (and modern privacy practices). We do not, cannot, and shall not gaze upon your coinpurse. Any payment details you entrust to Patreon remain solely within their keeping.

---

## ⏳ Quotas & Usage

**Q: How do monthly creation limits work?**

**A:** Each tier grants you a number of creations per month (tracked by your account). You can spend these on generating encounters, creatures, and NPCs through Lorexicon.

- If your job fails, you’re never charged.
- If you simply don’t like a result, it still counts — but if something goes truly awry or you have recurring issues, just reach out to [Support](https://github.com/Fergusware/lorexicon-support) and we’ll help.
- Unused creations do not roll over -- when the new moon rises, your spell slots reset.
  Think of it like spell slots—plan your casting wisely!

**Q: So just to be clear, I am _not_ charged if my job fails?**

**A:** Never! If your spell fizzles or your rogue trips the trap, you won’t lose any gold -- or credits, in this case. Your usage is always displayed for you on-screen, as easily as checking your hit points before diving into a dungeon.

**Q: Why _do_ some jobs fail?**

**A:** Even the most seasoned wizards can hit a stubborn spell, and our conjuration engine is no exception. On rare occasions, it simply refuses to cooperate -- tricks of the arcane, we suppose. When that happens, we beg your pardon and humbly ask you to submit again. Know that with each hiccup, we’re probing its hidden runes and teaching it new lessons, so the next summoning has an ever-better chance of success.

**Q: Why did my image never appear, even though the job completed?**

**A:** Ah, the fickle whims of the aether! On occasion, our image conjurer stumbles upon a subject that the moderation wards deem too perilous to render. Rather than letting your entire ritual collapse in a puff of void, we allow the generation to finish without the visual component. This prevents a “permanent failure” that would block that and similar creations in the future. The incantation still consumes its allotted charge, as the energy was spent attempting the summon — even if the image itself was banished mid-ritual.

You’ll know when this occurs: the Results panel will note that the conjuration completed without an image, marking the attempt safely contained by the wards.

**Q: What happens if I cancel a job?**

**A:** Canceling a job before it completes does **not** deduct from your monthly quota—think of it as calling off the ritual before the final incantation. Your resources remain intact, and you can try again immediately. _However_, if cancellations become frequent enough to resemble mischief (dozens of aborted runs in rapid succession), the Lorexicon Guild reserves the right to intercede and guard against abuse.

## 💰 Billing & Tiers

**Q: What happens if my payment fails? Or if I change tiers?**

**A:** Fear not -- the Loreicon's magic is flexible.

- If your payment fails, your access to the Guild’s forges will pause, but no penalties shall befall you.
- If you resolve the issue, access returns as swiftly as a recalled familiar.
- If you change tiers, your quota will adjust within the hour -- no rituals required.
  For refunds, please consult Patreon’s scribes; we cannot issue them ourselves.

**Q: Why do I have to log into Patreon?**

**A:** Great question! Most modules live entirely on your local map; they never leave your screen. Lorexicon, however, uses both client and server -- to authenticate you via Patreon, track your monthly guild dues, and securely invoke our backend service for you. That extra login ensures you’re truly the hero you claim to be.

**Q: How do I get Free Tier access? Do I need to join the Patreon**

**A:** No arcane rituals required! To gain Free Tier access (3 creations per month), simply log in with your Patreon account. If you’re an active patron, you’ll receive your Guild rank benefits automatically. Joining is encouraged for announcements, but it’s not required for Free Tier access.

_Note: Fergusware reserves the right to alter or remove Free Tier quotas at any time._

## 🤖 Technical & Models

**Q: Just to be clear, this service is backed by AI?**

**A:** Only in part. The real magic lives in the code -- rule logic, automation, and Foundry integration all run on solid craftsmanship, not machine whimsy. The AI lends a hand for creative spark: parsing your prompt into a concept, weaving a bit of narrative flavor, and (if you wish) painting the scene with an image. Think of it less as an all-powerful sorcerer, and more as a clever apprentice helping translate your intent into something beautifully playable.

**Q: What AI service do you use?**

**A:** We currently summon the power of OpenAI’s arcane engines. We’re also perusing tomes on Anthropic and Gemini and may grant you the choice of familiars (AI providers) in the near future.

**Q: What model do you use?**

**A:** By default, the lean-and-mean **gpt-4o-mini**, balanced to keep costs down while still conjuring clever results. Higher-end models may become available as premium Guild upgrades soon.

**Q: Can I bring my own API key?**

**A:** We’re deliberating that option at the council table. If lowering your personal cost is a quest you’d embark on, your feedback will help us decide!

---

## 🗄️ Retention & Recovery

**Q: How long do you retain my creations?**

**A:** Your quest log (or job history) lives forever in our archives, while the conjurations (JSON and images) remain in our vault for **90 days** before we gently release them back into the wild.

**Q: I accidentally deleted my creation. Can I get it back?**

**A:** Not automatically (yet), but our support scribes can assist. Visit our [Support Page](https://github.com/Fergusware/lorexicon-support) and we'll help recover your lost treasure.

---

## 🎓 Lore & Origins

**Q: Where did you get the idea for Lorexicon?**

**A:** Funny you ask! It all began as a brainstorming session with ChatGPT, imagining how AI could level up tabletop adventures. And thus, Lorexicon was born!
