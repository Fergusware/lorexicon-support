Before you invoke the Lorexiconâ€™s power, ensure your realm meets these glyphs:

- **Foundry VTT**: v12.343 or later
- **Pathfinder 2e Remaster**: v6.12 or later
- **Dependencies**: None -â€” Lorexicon stands alone

---

### Chapter II: Invoking the Module

1. In Foundryâ€™s **Add-on Modules â†’ Install Module**, paste the manifest oracle:

   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fergusware/lorexicon-support/refs/heads/main/manifests/module.json
   ```

2. Click **Install**, then in **Manage Modules** enable **Lorexicon**.
3. Restart your Foundry realm if the fates demand it.

---

### Chapter III: Opening the Lorexicon Portal

To call Lorexicon forth:

1. Venture to either the **Actors** tab or **Journal** tab of your Foundry interface.
2. Click the **Lorexicon** button nestled at the bottom.
3. On first start, you will be prompted to **Bind Your Patreon Pact** (see below).
4. Behold the enchanted prompt window, alive with your monthly usage runes.

---

### Chapter IV: Binding Your Patreon Pact

When you first awaken Lorexiconâ€™s arcane circuits, you must forge a Patreon pact:

1. Upon enabling, a new popup window beckonsâ€”ensure your browser allows pop-ups for Foundry.
2. If you are not yet logged into Patreon, youâ€™ll be prompted for credentials.
3. In that window, grant access:
   - **Lorexicon** would like to view your Patreon identity, pledges, and account status
   - This ritual weaves your Patreon allegiance into the very fabric of your Foundry realm.
4. Success seals the pact -â€” Lorexiconâ€™s welcome grimoire unfurls in Foundry.
5. Failure or denial scrawls an error in chat.
6. At any time, you may unbind the ritual by clicking the ðŸ”— Unlink icon in the Usage panel.

### Chapter V: The Welcome Invocation

When first summoned, Lorexicon will unfurl its greeting as a herald in the Chat tab, welcoming you to the forge of creation.

### Chapter VI: Crafting Your Creation

| **Arcane Element** | **Description**                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Type**           | Lore Codex: **Encounter**, **NPC**, or **Creature**                                                                      |
| **Prompt**         | Vast textarea (up to 12,000 characters) for your narrative or mechanical visions                                         |
| **Result**         | When the summoning is complete, displays your creationâ€™s name, linked to its freshly born document                       |
| **Usage Panel**    | â€¢ **Completed:** x / y<br>â€¢ **Remaining:** z (flames red at 0)<br>â€¢ **Patreon ID:** 12345 ðŸ”—<br>â€¢ **Subscription:** free |
| **Buttons**        | â€¢ **Submit**: commence creation<br>â€¢ **Cancel**: banish or close the portal<br>â€¢ **Reset**: clear all runes              |

Below the runes, a **Progress Bar** pulses while the forge works its magic (~30-60 seconds).

---

### Chapter VII: The Summoning of Your Creation

When the progress bar runs its course:

- Lorexicon conjures your creation into the world -- safely nestled within a "Lorexicon" folder on the **Actor** or **Journal** tab.
- The creation opens automatically.
- The **Result** rune bears the name of the creation as a link -- your new creation awaits.

_No further import rituals are required to begin using your creation._

---

### Chapter VIII: Tracking Your Magical Quota

Each monthâ€™s magic is finite. Observe your Usage Panel:

- **Completed:** Prompts expended this month
- **Remaining:** Spells left (resets at the turn of the calendar)
- **Patreon ID:** Your bonded Patreon identity (click ðŸ”— to sever the bond)
- **Subscription:** Your current tier (beta testers dwell in "free", rewarded with an increased quota)

Hover any rune for further illumination.

### Chapter IX: When the Fates Frown

Should darkness cloud your ritual:

| **Affliction**                   | **Lorexiconâ€™s Response**                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Auth Denied/Failure**          | Chat scrolls an "authentication error" -- reopen the popup and retry.          |
| **Quota Depleted**               | A red "Remaining" rune blazes 0; a toast and chat warning cry "No more magic." |
| **Generation Timeout/API Error** | Chat: "Generation failed -â€” please try again."                                 |
| **Popup Blocked/Closed/Timeout** | Chat: "Patreon authentication failed. Allow pop-ups and retry."                |

---

### Chapter X: Sage Advice & Troubleshooting

- **Lorexicon button vanished?** Ensure the module is enabled and your realm restarted.
- **Pop-up barred?** Permit pop-ups for your Foundry domain.
- **Remaining stuck at 0?** Quotas renew at the start of each calendar month.
- **Auth errors persist?** Click ðŸ”— to unlink, then reforge your Patreon pact.
